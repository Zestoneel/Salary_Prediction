# Salary Prediction (Python)
The purpose of this project is to use data transformation and machine learning to create a model that will predict a salary when given years of experience, job type, college degree, college major, industry, and miles from a metropolis.


# Methodology

 - Data Wrangling - `Removed duplicates and dropped misssing or null values in the dataset.`
 - Exploratory Data Analysis - `Analyzed the data and summarized the main characteristics.`
 - Data Visualization - `Used boxplot, distribution plot, scatter plot, violin plot, residual plot and regression plot to visualize the data and it's characteristics.`
 - Machine Learning Algorithms Used - `Linear Regression, Polynomial Transformation, Ridge Regression and Random Forest`
 - Evaluation Metrics Used - `Mean Squared Error(MSE) and R-squared`
